## üìù DESCRIPTION

Cyber Runner is a retrowave-styled game where you need to navigate through multiple lanes and beat enemies.

The mechanics are quite simple and the game is not too complex, because it was made for a simple school project. You can still try out the game though, just don't expect anything too fancy! :D

## üî• FEATURES

* Lane switching game
* Neon-Cyber themed environment
* 3 different zones
* Challenging enemies
* Synthwave music
